# 100 Days of Code
While I've always been interested in solving problems with technology, I've decided to finally commit to learning how to do so. While I'm great at the "customer service" aspect of listening to people's problems, understand the complexities behind them, and explain a solution back to them in simple terms, I'd like to learn a bit more about the technicalities of coding, to improve my current and future career prospects.
<p>I don't have a Twitter, but think this is good enough for me.
