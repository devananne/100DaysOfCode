# 100 Days of Code
While I've always been interested in solving problems with technology, I've decided to finally commit to learning how to do so. While I'm great at the "customer service" aspect of listening to people's problems, understand the complexities behind them, and explain a solution back to them in simple terms, I'd like to learn a bit more about the technicalities of coding, to improve my current and future career prospects.
<p>I don't have a Twitter, but think this is good enough for me.

<p>Today was harder than I was anticipating. These examples seemed less clear than previously, or I wasn't actually understanding whatever the new syntax was actually doing. I struggle through some of these even though they should have been fairly straightforward, as I was really trying to grasp the point of them. 
  <h4>Javascript | ES6</h4>
  <p> - Use Destructuring Assignment with the Rest Parameter to Reassign Array Elements
  <br> - Use Destructuring Assignment to Pass an Object as a Function's Parameters
  <br> - <a href="Struggles/Day002">Create Strings using Template Literals</a>
  <br> - Write Concise Object Literal Declarations Using Object Property Shorthand
  <br> - Write Concise Declarative Functions with ES6
  <br> - Use class Syntax to Define a Constructor Function
